## Synopsis

This is an unpurposed game that is based on a tile-map system
and can be expanded to any game that a user chooses. Right now,
I don't have any really cool ideas for a story line, but I
the concept is there.

The folder jsmaps has all the js files that correspond to a
different 'map.' A map is a set of coordinates that is readily
accessable to the player without going through a 'gate'.

The 'gates' allow users to visit different maps.

## Installation

Open a unix terminal, change directories until you're in the same directory
as the "Makefile", then type make

drew@alfred$ make

## API Reference
This will require the Map. Each webpage html should only have one
map. The map is the visible part of the screen where the user
is, so going through a gate will move you to a new map.
```javascript
var Map = require('../map');
```

This will construct the map with the first parameter creating
the width with, and the second parameter creating the height.
```javascript
Map.generateMap( int width, int height);
Map.generateMap( 13,18);
```

This will randomly generate npc characters that walk around the map
aimlessly. They'll just wander around and you can talk to them, but
right now, they'll just tel you their name.
```javascript
Map.generateCrowd(9);
```

A gate is a path from one map to another map. It's good practice for
north gate to enter the next map from the south so that the user
has some continuation between maps. The second paramter says which
edge of the current map the gate will appear on, and the third
parameter will say how far from the left the gate will be.

The second parameter can be only "north", "east", "south", "west".
```javascript
Map.insertGate(string thisMap, string wallOfMap, int fromLeft)
Map.insertGate("Route7", "north", 8);
```

This will just start the map and name is. When you make a new map
connecting, you should use the name provided here. 
```javascript
Map.initMap("Ikea");
```
