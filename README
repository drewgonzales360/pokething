# Code Snippets and Notes
This is the code that will draw a picture to the canvas. 

var img = new Image();
img.src = `file://${__dirname}/../grass.png`;
ctx.drawImage(img, view_x*TILE_SIZE, view_y*TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE);

# Poke-Thing
This is an unpurposed game that is based on a tile-map system
and can be expanded to any game that a user chooses. Right now,
I don't have any really cool ideas for a story line, but I
the concept is there. 

The folder jsmaps has all the js files that correspond to a 
different 'map.' A map is a set of coordinates that is readily 
accessable to the player without going through a 'gate'.

The 'gates' allow users to visit different maps. 

#Dependenceies
  - npm install key-emit
  
#ToDo:
  - clean code in map.js. The file needs to be broken up.
